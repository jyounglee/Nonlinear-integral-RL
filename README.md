# Nonlinear-integral-RL
This repository provides the open source code for reproducing the simulation results presented in the publication:

Lee, J.Y., Park, J.B. and Choi, Y.H. (2014). Integral Reinforcement Learning for a Class of Nonlinear Systems with Invariant Explorations. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 26(5), pp. 916~932.

To reproduce the results for each case in the paper, 

1. Set the MATLAB working directory to the corresponding subfolder in the cloned local repository path in your machine.
    
2. Run `Main_Nonlinear.m`

4. If necessary, change the hyper-parameters in `Main_Nonlinear.m`.
